This repository contains the official implementation of our paper submitted to **IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)** with title **"ClouDens: A Scalable Ensemble Framework for Robust Anomaly Detection in Large-Scale Cloud Systems"**.

ClouDens is an ensemble-based anomaly detection framework built on spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs), 
with features tailored for large-scale cloud telemetry.
This repository includes scripts for different steps, including data pre-processing, model engineering, anomaly scoring, and evaluation, with several built-ins being implemented. 
The pipeline is modularized for flexibility and ease of use.

## 🔍 Overview

![ClouDens Overview](figures/overview.png)


ClouDens employs an ensemble approach with the base model of ST-GNNs architecture with specific enhancements tailored for detecting anomalies in complex cloud environments. This repository includes:

- Preprocessing scripts for the IBM Cloud dataset 
- Forecasting-based architecture Code Implementation for  ClouDens and a GRU-based baseline
- Anomaly scoring on forecast errors with different strategies, including *Max Aggregation*, *Anomaly Likelihood Function*, and *Mahalanobis Distance*
- Evaluation using NAB scores, precision, recall, and false positive metrics

## 5 Execution - Using Virtual Environment

The workflow is configured using the [Hydra](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) framework.

### 5.1. Split the pivoted dataset into different feature subsets
The selected HTTP Status Codes and Aggregations can be configurable in the `config.yaml` file. 
Modify the following parameters under `data_preparation_pipeline`:
```yaml
data_preparation_pipeline:
  multiple_preprocessing: false # true or false
  feature_subsets:
    http_codes: ['5xx','4xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
    aggregations: ['count','avg','min','max']
    
  features_prep:
    filter:
      http_codes: ['5xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
      aggregations: ['count']
```
If `multiple_preprocessing: false`, the preprocessing script extracts and processes a single feature subset based on the 
specified HTTP status codes and aggregation method defined under `features_prep.filter` 
(`http_codes` and `aggregations`).

If set to `multiple_preprocessing: true`, the script generates multiple feature subsets by iterating over 
all combinations of `http_codes` and `aggregations` specified in `data_preparation_pipeline.feature_subsets`.

To extract feature subsets, preprocess them, and save the results to disk, run:
```bash
python src/run_preprocessing.py
```
This script will apply the preprocessing pipeline based on your configuration settings in `config.yaml`.

After preprocessing multiple feature subsets, the project directory will be organized as follows:
```plaintext
icse2026_cloudens_ad/
├── conf/                # Configuration files (e.g., config.yaml)
├── src/                 # Source code files
├── data/
│   ├── massaged/        # Pivoted input data
│   │   ├── extracted
│   │   │   ├── no_group_4xx_avg                # Feature subset folder according to 4xx (Status Code) and avg (Aggregation)
│   │   │   │   ├── adjacency_matrix.npy        # Adjacency matrix
│   │   │   │   ├── filtered_raw_data.parquet   # Processed data corresponding to feature subset
│   │   │   │   ├── meta_data.json              # Additional information about the graph representaion
│   │   │   ├── no_group_4xx_count
│   │   │   ├── ...  
│   ├── labels/          # Anomaly window labels
├── trained_models/      # Saved trained models
```
### 5.2 Configuring the Base Model Architecture

The model type (e.g., A3T-GCN or GRU) is configurable in the `config.yaml` file. Modify the following parameters under `evaluation`:

```yaml
evaluation:
  retrain: false
  use_model: 'GRU' # 'A3TGCN' or 'GRU'
```


### 5.3 Run the Project on a single feature subset
To train a single model on a single feature subset, execute the following script after setting up the required directories and input files:

```bash
python src/run_training_single_model.py
```
This script will choose the model and the feature subset based on your configuration settings in `config.yaml`, 
under `evaluation.use_model` and `data_preparation_pipeline.features_prep.filter`.

Note that you can pass configuration parameters directly via the command line. For example:
```bash
python src/run_training_single_model.py evaluation.use_model=A3TGCN evaluation.retrain=true  
```

Model outputs will be saved under the directory `trained_models/no_group_<feature subset>/<model name>`.

For example, training the `A3TGCN` model on the `5xx count` feature subset will produce the following structure:

```plaintext
trained_models/                                  # Final ensemble results
├── no_group_5xx_count        
│   ├── A3TGCN/                                  # A3TGCN trained model and relevant outputs on `5xx count` feature subset   
│   │   ├── A3TGCN_autoencoder.pt                # Saved model
│   │   ├── A3TGCN_grid_search.csv               # NAB Score with different thresholds and post-processing strategies
│   │   ├── A3TGCN_predictions_for_assembles.csv # Predicted labels for ensembling
│   │   ├── A3TGCN_train_val_losses.png
│   │   ├── mahalanobis.npy                      # Mahalanobis distance corresponding to `reconstruction_errors.npy`, saved for reuse
│   │   ├── mse_error.txt                        # MSE error on test data
│   │   ├── reconstruction_errors.npy            # Raw forecast errors for post-processing
│   ├── GRU/          
```
---

You can refer to `A3TGCN_grid_search.csv` to view NAB scores under both the `standard` and `low_fn` profiles, 
evaluated across different thresholds and post-processing strategies.


### 5.4 Run the Project with the ensemble approach

To get output of ensemble approach after training on all feature subsets (8 subsets in our paper), execute the following script:

```bash
python src/run_ensemble_approach.py
```

This script selects feature subsets based on the settings in `config.yaml`. It either:

- Iterates over all combinations of `http_codes` and `aggregations` defined in `evaluation.ensembles.auto_combination`, or

- Uses a specific combination defined in `evaluation.ensembles.manual_combination`.

The behavior is controlled by the `evaluation.ensembles.combination_mode` setting.


```yaml
evaluation:
  ensembles:
    combination_mode: 'manual'        # ['auto', 'manual']
    auto_combination:
      num_selection: 8
      http_codes: ['5xx','4xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
      aggregations: ['count','avg','min', 'max']
    manual_combination:
#      http_codes: [ '5xx','4xx' ] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
#      aggregations: [ 'count','min']
      http_codes: ['5xx','4xx'] # http codes can be 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
      aggregations: ['max','avg']
```

Note that you can pass configuration parameters directly via the command line. For example:
```bash
python src/run_ensemble_approach.py evaluation.use_model=A3TGCN evaluation.ensembles.combination_mode=manual  
```

The results from the ensemble approach are saved in the directory: `trained_models/ensemble/`
```plaintext
trained_models/                                  
├── ensemble/                                # Final ensemble outputs
│   ├── ensemble_final_result_no_group_5xx_count+no_group_4xx_min.csv   
│   ├── ensemble_final_result_no_group_5xx_max+no_group_4xx_avg.csv
│   ├── ensemble_final_result_no_group_5xx_count+no_group_5xx_avg+no_group_5xx_min+no_group_5xx_max+no_group_4xx_count+no_group_4xx_avg+no_group_4xx_min+no_group_4xx_max    
```
---

You can refer to `ensemble_final_result_no_group_5xx_count+no_group_4xx_min.csv` to view NAB scores under both 
the `standard` and `low_fn` profiles. 
These results are generated by ensembling outputs from two models trained on 
the `5xx count` and `4xx min` feature subsets. 

This report presents the NAB scores achieved under two selection strategies:

- Selecting the post-processing strategy that yields the highest NAB score under the `standard` profile

- Selecting the post-processing strategy that yields the highest NAB score under the `low_fn` profile (as reported in our paper)

The report also includes a list of all base models along with their corresponding post-processing configurations used during ensembling.

**Ensure that all base model outputs are generated before running the ensemble approach.**

## Notes for Replicability

- Use Python 3.12.2 to avoid compatibility issues.
- Keep the `requirements.txt` file up-to-date if new dependencies are added.
- Use the exact steps mentioned above to ensure a consistent environment across different setups.
